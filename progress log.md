 This repo is long overdue. I had multiple ideas for 20 times (video production, make a new boat design) but none of them seemed enticing or
 or applicable and my lack of motivation caused me to lag behind and not do anything. Ironically the game that you (Mr.Osudar) beleived 
 would distract me and waste my time is the insparation behind this project: I want to make a paperclips clone. A few things must be established
 before I can begin this project.
 1. I must plan out the entire game
 2. I must learn GUI functions in JS (or find a way around them)
 3. I must make sure I have a functioning work flow
 Lets hope this works

 This f****** sucks. I made log two, planned out the entire first phaze. I closed my computer and upon opening it crashed and i lost all 
 of my work

It's time to get back on track. My workflow works, so that it not an issue. I have yet to learn about GUI's but Mr.O suggested that I learn interactive HTML/CSS and integrate it with the java; more on that in future. The game will have three stages all very different, but with some elements of the previous stage integrated back into the next. The game will begin with a pretty simple tast, but will end with monitoring and managing multiple streams of information. The aim of the game starts with writing lines of code and ends with you turning the whole universe into a super computer.

Stage one
-you click a button and "write" a line of code. 
-every line of code costs a joule of electricity
-you can buy joules by the Kj (cost starts at 15$ +- 5$[increases by 0.03% every purchase]
{buy bots, they make one line of code per second}(cost 2$ +0.15% every purchase)
{creatre a thinktank, generates upgrades for the rest of the game. Can buy more snacks and more beanbags}
