 This repo is long overdue. I had multiple ideas for 20 times (video production, make a new boat design) but none of them seemed enticing or
 or applicable and my lack of motivation caused me to lag behind and not do anything. Ironically the game that you (Mr.Osudar) beleived 
 would distract me and waste my time is the insparation behind this project: I want to make a paperclips clone. A few things must be established
 before I can begin this project.
 1. I must plan out the entire game
 2. I must learn GUI functions in JS (or find a way around them)
 3. I must make sure I have a functioning work flow
 Lets hope this works
